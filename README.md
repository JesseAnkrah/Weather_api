# Weather_api

This is my weather checking application it will provide current temp along with things like 
To get started all you need to do is select "zip code" or "city name" mode.
Then you will be prompted to either give the zip code of the area you desire
or give the name of the city and two letter state code EX: maryland = MD, illinois = IL.


This is the city name example run:
"name" - to swap to the name based api
"gaithersburg" - to determine city
"MD" - to determine state

This is the zip code example run:
"zip" - swap to the zip code based api
"20742" - college park zip code
